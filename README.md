Developed a web application using Spring Boot (Java 17) for backend and React.js for frontend, with
MySQL for data management. Utilized IntelliJ IDEA for development and Git/GitHub for version control and
code reviews. Designed a custom third-party component to facilitate seamless communication between the
React.js frontend and Spring Boot backend, integrating with a MySQL database for enhanced data
interaction.
